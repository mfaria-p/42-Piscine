# **42 Piscine**

The 42 Porto Piscine is a challenging, month-long program that immerses participants in a unique learning environment focused on self-teaching, teamwork, and problem-solving. During this time, I worked on coding projects, peer-reviewed others' work, and collaborated with fellow participants to overcome complex challenges.

Through this experience, I learned __C__ and __shell scripting__, gaining a strong foundation in low-level programming and system operations. I also developed the ability to think independently, manage my time effectively, and adapt quickly to new problems. Peer-to-peer learning helped me improve my ability to explain concepts and learn from different perspectives. The fast-paced environment taught me resilience and perseverance.

By the end of the Piscine, I had not only improved my technical skills but also developed a problem-solving mindset and a strong appreciation for teamwork. This experience was both intense and rewarding, preparing me for future challenges in programming.
